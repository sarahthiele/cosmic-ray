# CR Diffusion fit function (Equation 20 in Sampson+(2022)

    Fit function for the parallel diffusion coefficient and ratio
    of diffusion coefficients k_parallel/k_perpendicular as derived

    INPUTS:
    f [string] ------- value to calculate. Choose from {"k_ratio",
                       "k_perp", "u_v"}.
    M_A0 [array] ----- array of Alfven Mach numbers from RAMSES snapshot.
                       Should be dimensionless.
    chi [array] ------ ionization fraction of each cell in RAMSES snapshot
                       as found using the cooling tables of RAMSES.
